Brief investigation into a network anomaly caused by the Netflix app for Dish recievers
The attached document is my notes from this "investigation" that caused Netflix to use roughly 117TBs of network traffic over the last few months.
Most of the IPs and sites appear to just be log collectors for netflix. Upon checking in virus total, a few were marked for phishing, but usually with only a point or two.
If anyone sees this and knows more, please let me know.

Thank you.
